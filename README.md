# Sound Good Music School Database Interface
Interface using Java for the PostgreSQL database made for Sound Good Music School in the IV1351 course.

### JDBC
The latest PostgreSQL JDBC (42.5.1) is used in order to connect to the database.
It is included in the project, found in the [`lib` folder](https://github.com/Cactooz/SoundGoodMusicSchoolInterface/tree/main/lib).

### SQL
The SQL for creating the database and inserting data and views are included in this project in the
[`sql` folder](https://github.com/Cactooz/SoundGoodMusicSchoolInterface/tree/main/sql).
It is exactly the same database and date as used in the previous tasks in the project.

### Other tasks
Task 1-3 of the project can be found in my other [SoundGoodMusicSchool repo](https://github.com/Cactooz/SoundGoodMusicSchool) with all models and SQL related files.
